These two functions will change the current board state. And they both return an identifier, which can let ``Board.main()`` determine whether the game should be continued or the game is winned by a player.\r\n- In ``randomPlay``, the player just plays the game randomly, while the player plays according to the algorithm in algorithmPlay.\r\n- In ``algorithmPlay``, just three things are done: first, set up parameters like number of descents, the root of descent tree; second, call ``Ep.descent`` to do descent whose parameter the the root; third, determine which move is the best one.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### ``Ep`` (Expectation-Propagation)\r\nCore of the expectation propagation algorithm:\r\n\r\n- Basically, in this module, the algorithm is implemented and all related message passing methods are implemented.\r\n- The method descent is the backbone and other message passing methods serve for it.\r\n- Additionally, all calculation related to Gaussian distribution are carried out in ``Distribution`` module.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### ``Distribution``\r\n- All dirty works of calculation about Gaussian distributions and correlated coefficient.\r\n- In this module, all messy distribution and correlated coefficient calcualtions are implemented.\r\n- Notice should be paid tothe Min/Max calculation of multiple dependent Gaussian distributions.\r\n\r\n#### ``Node``\r\nSupport build-up of ``Game`` tree:\r\n\r\n- It is an entity  module, which supports implementation of ``Game`` node in a ``Game`` tree.\r\n- In every node, it has both pointer to its parent and its children.\r\n- Also, binded values and distributions are its properties.\r\n- Notice: the ``getChild()`` function is varied if the ``Board`` is changed. For different game board, the strategy to get valid children nodes of a specific node is varied\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### License and authors\r\n- Forked and cleaned up by [Lilian Besson (Naereen)](https://github.com/Naereen), 28/12/2015,\r\n- Created by [Pengkun Liu](https://github.com/Charles-Lau-/), June 2015,\r\n- Code released under the [MIT license](http://lbesson.mit-license.org).\r\n","google":"UA-38514290-17","note":"Don't delete this file!
